# Implementation Steps
# Step 1: Loading SSVEP open datastes. These datasets links are sourced from: http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.
# Step 2: Install MATLAB 2022 R2 and run the preprocess_compared.m script to perform data preprocessing.
# Step 3: Configure the virtual environment according to the requirements file.
# Step 4: Run the Main file. Net_struct_2.py contains TBMSCCN、 Bi-SiamCA and Conv_CA model.
